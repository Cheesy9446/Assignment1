2A. 
Most smartphones have screens from around 300-600 pixels. So setting the max to 600 would make it that anything less will use the mobile.css file instead of any other. If it goes above 600 then it will move to the next css file which would be  tablet.css

Most tablets have screens ranging from 600-1024 pixels. This makes it so whenever a device that is 600-1024 pixels wide/tall, itll use the appropriate css file. Anything above will move on to the next css file 

Most Laptops/PC's are above 1024 pixels. So making this the max will ensure the layout is proper for much larger screens. 

2B. 

I used the linear and angle gradient in my "Projects" tab on my portfolio. I tried to make it a mix of different colors of the sky with the color scheme link provided.

2C. 

I used a scheme trying to mimic the colors of the sky in different shades.
